Bug 1: 
While starting the application after downloading from spring initializer, faced the below bug. 
"Failed to configure a DataSource: no embedded datasource could be configured."
This was because of 2 reasons:
1. since the datasoure, username and pwd was not configured in application.properties .
Solution:
 Hence installed postgres, updated the application.properties and updated pom with postgre driver dependency
